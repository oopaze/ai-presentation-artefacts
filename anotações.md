### Explain the relation between big data and machine learning
- Explain relation between data and learning process
- Expose the type of learning process (Supervised | Unsupervised)


### Talk about supervised machine learning
- Explain the concerns
- Talk about the application
- Give algorithm examples


### Talk about unsupervised machine learning
- Explain concerns
- Talk about application
- Give some algorithms examples (K-Means Clustering, Apriori Algorithm)


### Apriori Algorithm
- Explain `support`, `confidence` and `lift`
- Explain what lift variation means
- Explain how apriori uses these 3 concerns


### Make apriori algorithm demonstration
- Open jupyter notebook
- Explain line by line what is happing
- Show both demonstrations
